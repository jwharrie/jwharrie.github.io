      <p>
        For my course in comparative programming languages, I was tasked in developing a project that utilized 3 separate programming languages. I decided 
        to develop a CLI calorie tracker app that combined the best features of Python, C and JavaScript. The app would run in a Docker container so that 
        it can run independent of the user's operating system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Python was chosen to run the user interface on the command line. Users would be given prompts to enter data or type in a menu option. Python would validate 
        the user's input to prevent unwanted behaviours. As a scripting language with garbage collecting and dynamic-typing, I felt that Python would be a great 
        choice to quickly implement a CLI that can run as long as the user wishes. Python's exception handling also made it easy for users to return to previous 
        menus or cancel data CRUD operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        C was used to execute simple but vital functions. These functions are responsible for unit conversions, calculating calorie amounts, output selection 
        and input validation. C functions are more efficient for their static typing and static binding, which 
        was why these operations were written in C rather than Python. The Python code accessed the C code through SWIG, a foreign function interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript was used to run a Node.js server under the Express.js framework. The server would receive requests from the Python code and then send back 
        responses. The Node.js environment allowed for fast, asynchronous and event-driven performance that can respond to user requests at any moment. It also 
        made it easy for me to perform CRUD operations for personal user and food data.
